# RB Leipzig Support App
It is an android app for fans of the german football club "RB Leipzig". It was released on february 2017 and gained some big updates until 2022.
This project is not actively maintained anymore besides hotfixes and in-app updates. I used this app to teach myself android programming.
It may contain some flaws like
hardcoded strings. RB Leipzig has recognized this app as a fan project and allows the use of the brand name. For more information please visit the store page.

**CURRENT STATUS OF THE APP: WORKING**
